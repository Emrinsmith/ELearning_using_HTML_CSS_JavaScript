                    A testimonial in e-learning is a written statement that provides feedback on a person's experience with an online course. Testimonials can help contribute to the success of an online course. 
                    In general, a testimonial is a written statement that can have multiple meanings, including:A formal or old-fashioned statement about someone's character or qualities A formal written description of someone's character and qualities given by a previous employer 
                    A recommendation of the quality of a consumer product or service An expression of appreciation, tribute, or evidence E-learning is especially conducive to cohort learning where groups of people who live in different locations work on obtaining a new skill or knowledge set. Cost efficiency. In a traditional, in-person classroom setting, the cost of the space, infrastructure, maintenance and materials adds up.
                    The second way e-learning evolves is that there are more opportunities for people to learn online. There are more platforms, such as Coursera, Udacity, and Edx, which offer free online courses from universities around the world. Finally, e-learning evolves when it becomes more accessible to people who may not be able to afford traditional college or university classes.
                    The future of e-learning will be determined by how it continues to evolve in these three ways: improving technology, expanding opportunities for learning online through new platforms and making it accessible to everyone who wants to learn something new or advance their career through education.
